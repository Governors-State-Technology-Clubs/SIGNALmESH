*Signal Mesh for Electronic Service Handling – An Event Handling and Data Processing Project*

> A Discord-based Club Management Bot created to support member tracking, joint organization collaboration, automate recognition systems, and provide data-driven insights for the Computer Science Society Club at **Governor State University**.

## 🧠 Project Summary

**SIGNALmESH** is a club bot developed to address internal communication issues in the organization, joint organization collaboration issues, and the lack of infrastructure for tracking member growth and recognizing contributions within the Computer Science Society at **Governor State University**.

This bot provides automation to help close resource gaps and supports internal club data collection and analysis. By logging member participation, assigning points, and enabling merit-based promotions and recommendations, SIGNALmESH allows students to organize professional peer environments while remaining accessible to the broader student community.
